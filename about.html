                        <p>The Eileen Fitzgerald School of Speech and Drama gave me some of the most memorable years of
                            my life. From Junior Infants all the way up to Leaving Cert, I was with Eileen competing in
                            Feile Luimnigh and completing my grades with the Irish Board. Classes with Eileen and Ciara
                            were always a positive and banterful experience, with an emphasis on a wide range of
                            important skills that I've come to realise are so very prominant in our everyday
                            lives.<br><br>

                            I am most appreciative of all the work that Eileen and Ciara have put into me over the
                            years. Many a time I was nervous to go up on stage, and now what I would do to relive some
                            of
                            the glory. I would highly recommend these classes as there is so much to gain. <br><br>

                            Eileen Fitzgerald is a wonderful teacher and a great communicator with students of all ages.
                            She is an empathetic leader who cares about her students and their experiences in her class.

                            It is no wonder that Eileen remains friends with many of her past pupils.

                            and I am all the better for it. Eileen is a wonderful teacher and mentor. She is completely
                            devoted to her students and has been a great support to me in projects I’ve taken on after
                            attending her school. The teaching I received from Eileen has made a great and lasting
                            impact on my communication and performance skills. Eileen creates a learning environment
                            that is friendly, fun and wherein all students feel encouraged to reach their full
                            potential. I can’t recommend Eileen and her school of Speech and Drama highly enough.</p>
